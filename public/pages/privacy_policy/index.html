<h2 id="how-we-use-your-information">How We Use Your Information</h2>
<p>We use your information, including your personal information, for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>To provide our Services to you and demonstrate features and functions of our Services.</li>
<li>To communicate with you about your use of our Services, and to respond to your inquiries.</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="how-we-share-your-information">How We Share Your Information</h2>

</ul>
<h2 id="our-use-of-cookies-and-other-tracking-mechanisms">Our Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Mechanisms</h2>
<p>We and our service providers use cookies and other tracking mechanisms to track information about your use of our Sites or Services. We may combine this information with other personal information we collect from you (and our service providers may do so on our behalf). We use cookies for functional purposes only (i.e. to support the proper working of our Sites and Services) and do not use cookies for advertising or profiling purposes.</p>
<p>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your device’s hard drive through your web browser for record-keeping purposes. Some cookies allow us to make it easier for you to navigate our Sites and Services, while others are used to enable a faster log-in process or to allow us to track your activities at our Sites and Service. There are two types of cookies: session and persistent cookies.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Session cookies:</em> exist only during an online session. They disappear from your device when you close your browser or turn off your device. We use session cookies to allow our systems to uniquely identify you during a session or while you are logged into the Sites and Services. This allows us to process your online transactions and requests and verify your identity, after you have logged in, as you move through our Sites and Services.</li>
<li><em>Persistent Cookies:</em> Persistent cookies remain on your device after you have closed your browser or turned off your device. We use persistent cookies to track aggregate and statistical information about user activity.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Disabling Cookies:</strong> Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can change your browser options to block them in the future. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Visitors to our Sites and Services who disable cookies will be able to browse certain areas of the Sites, but some features may not function properly.</p>
<p><strong>Third Party Analytics:</strong> We use automated devices and applications, such as Google Analytics, to evaluate usage of our Sites. We use these tools to help us improve our site’s performance and user experiences.</p>
<p><strong>Do-Not-Track.</strong> Currently, our systems do not recognize browser “do-not-track” requests. You may, however, disable certain tracking as discussed in this section (e.g., by disabling cookies).</p>
<h2 id="user-generated-content">User Generated Content</h2>
<p>We invite you to post content on our Sites and Services, including your comments, pictures, and any other information that you would like to be available on our Sites or Services. If you post content to our Sites or Services the information that you post will be available to all visitors to our Sites. If you post your own content on our Sites or Services, your posting may become public and we cannot prevent such information from being used by third parties.</p>
<h2 id="third-party-links">Third-Party Links</h2>
<p>Our Sites and Services may contain links to third-party websites. Any access to, and use of, such linked websites is not governed by this Policy, but instead is governed by the privacy policies of those third-party websites. We are not responsible for the information practices of such third-party websites.</p>
<h2 id="security-of-my-personal-information">Security of My Personal Information</h2>
<p>We have implemented reasonable precautions to protect the information we collect from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Please be aware that despite our best efforts, no data security measures can guarantee security.</p>
<p>You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password, phone, and computer by, among other things, signing off after using a shared computer, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, and keeping your log-in and password private. We are not responsible for any lost, stolen, or compromised passwords or for any activity on your account via unauthorized password activity.</p>
<h2 id="what-choices-do-i-have-regarding-use-of-my-personal-information">What Choices Do I Have Regarding Use of My Personal Information?</h2>
<p>We may send periodic promotional emails to you regarding SpiffWorkflow. You may opt-out of promotional emails by following the opt-out instructions contained in the email. Please note that it may take up to 10 business days for us to process opt-out requests. If you opt-out of receiving promotional emails, we may still send you emails about your account or any services you have requested or received from us.</p>
<h2 id="additional-privacy-rights-under-gdpr">Additional Privacy Rights under GDPR</h2>
<p>Where the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) applies, in particular when you are accessing the Sites from a country in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), you have the following rights, subject to applicable limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li>The right to access your personal information;</li>
<li>The right to rectify the personal information we hold about you;</li>
<li>The right to erase your personal information;</li>
<li>The right to restrict our use of your personal information;</li>
<li>The right to object to our use of your personal information;</li>
<li>The right to receive your personal information in a usable electronic format and transmit it to a third party (also known as the right of data portability); and</li>
<li>The right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you would like to exercise any of these rights, you may do so submitting a request to us using our Contact Us form, and including “GDPR Privacy Request” in the message box. Please understand, however, the rights enumerated above are not absolute in all cases.</p>
<p>When you submit a GDPR request to us we may request additional information from you to confirm your identity.</p>
<p>We will make best efforts to voluntarily provide the above rights to individuals outside of the EEA. We will endeavor to comply with GDPR requests within 45 days of receipt, but if we need additional time to handle the request we will notify you.</p>
<h2 id="children-under-13">Children Under 13</h2>
<p>Our Services are not designed for children under 13. If we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will delete such information from our systems.</p>
<h2 id="contact-us">Contact Us</h2>
<p>If you have questions about the privacy aspects of our Services or would like to make a complaint, please contact us using our Contact Us form.</p>
<h2 id="changes-to-this-policy">Changes to this Policy</h2>
<p>This Policy is current as of the Effective Date set forth above. We may change this Policy from time to time, so please be sure to check back periodically. We will post any changes to this Policy on our Sites. If we make any changes to this Policy that materially affect our practices with regard to the personal information we have previously collected from you we will endeavor to provide you with notice in advance of such change by highlighting the change on our Sites.</p>
