      <description>What is Low-Code / No-Code? Low Code and No Code describe tools that allow people to create software applications (web sites, mobile apps, games, etc…) using graphical tools that don’t require writing code in traditional programming languages. There are some brilliant examples - and they aren’t new - the idea has been around for … ever. We’ve always been trying to make it easier to talk to computers. Check out MIT’s Scratch which helps introduce software concepts to young students, or consider what anyone can do these days with WordPress.</description>

      <description>(originally posted on Medium)&#xA;SpiffWorkflow allows your python application to process BPMN diagrams (think of them as very powerful flow charts) to accomplish what would otherwise require writing a lot of complex business logic in your code. You can use these diagrams to accomplish a number of tasks, such as:&#xA;Creating an online questionnaire which changes depending on the answers to previous questions Building a complex approval process that needs to be handed off between multiple people Allowing non-developers to make iterative changes to the flow of an application over time SpiffWorkflow can do all of this while drastically improving communication within multidisciplinary teams, allowing more people to contribute to your application and making it more resilient to changing requirements.</description>
