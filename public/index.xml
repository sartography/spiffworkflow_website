      <description>What is Low-Code / No-Code? Low Code and No Code describe tools that allow people to create software applications (web sites, mobile apps, games, etc…) using graphical tools that don’t require writing code in traditional programming languages. There are some brilliant examples - and they aren’t new - the idea has been around for … ever. We’ve always been trying to make it easier to talk to computers.

      <description>Felix on the SpiffWorkflow Discord Channel asked:&#xA;hey all, I am designing an approval process using spiff-workflow, a multi instances user task has 3 assignees, the task should complete if more than 2 users approve. Is SpiffWorkflow able to do this?&#xA;Alex (our modeling and business analysis expert) built the following diagram to think through how best to describe a set of parallel tasks that can interrupt each other in a way that would support Felix&amp;rsquo;s questions.</description>

      <title>BPMN Messages in SpiffWorkflow</title>

      <description>This is a deep dive into BPMN 2.0 Messages and how we implemented them in our open source project SpiffWorkflow. This will be primarily of interest to people who care about the BPMN 2.0 standard or are developing larger applications with Spiffworkflow that would benefit from having their BPMN diagrams communicate with each other. This is thick material, but there is a beautiful idea here well worth understanding, and beneficial to anyone who is interested in prolonged communications between complex systems.</description>

      <title>Data Objects in SpiffWorkflow</title>

      <description>A Simple Default One of the benefits of both BPMN and Python is they have long low-sloped learning curves. Things are simple by default, but have the ability to grow to meet far more complex situations. As we introduce new concepts into SpiffWorkflow we want the default behavior to be equally intuitive and powerful.&#xA;In SpiffWorkflow, data follows the process flow. Each task receives all data from the previously executed task.</description>

      <description>(originally posted on Medium)&#xA;SpiffWorkflow allows your python application to process BPMN diagrams (think of them as very powerful flow charts) to accomplish what would otherwise require writing a lot of complex business logic in your code. You can use these diagrams to accomplish a number of tasks, such as:&#xA;Creating an online questionnaire which changes depending on the answers to previous questions Building a complex approval process that needs to be handed off between multiple people Allowing non-developers to make iterative changes to the flow of an application over time SpiffWorkflow can do all of this while drastically improving communication within multidisciplinary teams, allowing more people to contribute to your application and making it more resilient to changing requirements.</description>
