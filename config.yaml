    title: It's about people
    subtitle: We bet the future is not about monitizing people using automated systems.  We believe in a future filled with human innovation that is supported by software that increases transparency, understanding, and collaboration.
    features:
    - title: Create Transparency
      text: Only when people understand processes will they contribute to their improvement.  Executable diagrams allow people to see what is happening behind the curtains.  The benefit of transparency is twofold&colon;  it creates empathy ("I didn't know you were handling so much!") and it provides power ("Hey, if we reviewed this earlier it would save everyone a lot of time").
      icon: transparency
    - title: Automate The Bots
      text: No one wants 20 applications telling them what to do all day.  In many cases, what we need is a little glue -- a way to pull information from one system and use it in another.  The Service Tasks in our diagrams allows us to talk to services, gather information, send that information to other services, getting ourselves out of the loop.

    - title: Deliver on Schedule
      text: Computers make great clock watchers, so let them do it.  We need more time by the fireplace for contemplation and less time responding to our endlessly beeping phones with their often pointless interruptions.    If we can reduce the noise and think in peace, then perhaps we can do something of merit, of consequence -- something worthy of our precious time.
