## Documentation

We continuously update and maintain [our documentation](https://spiff-arena.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
Our docs include a quick start guide and a reference guide for building diagrams, and a support section that covers how to modify running processes in production.
We also cover more technical details, such as how to contribute to this open-source project, and provide a dedicated dev/ops section that covers complex installation and integration concerns.

## Core Python Library Documentation

We maintain a separate Read The Docs page for [our SpiffWorkflow Python Library](https://spiffworkflow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
This is for people who want to develop their own BPMN Orchestration Engine from the ground up.
Our core library contains few dependencies and is focused on serializing and executing BPMN diagrams.

## Videos

You can find a number of our videos on our [SpiffWorkflow Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtDHzDfhyvnAb8CFmdwucUA).
