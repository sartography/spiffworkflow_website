We are in the process of building a series of Enterprise level integrations and extensions to assure that SpiffWorkflow can meet the needs of large scale organizations.  

## Authentication
Integration with OpenID systems from Google, Microsoft, and others, or use internal systems like LDAP or Active Directory, KeyCloak, or others.

## Connectors
We are building a library of ready-to-use Connectors for your Service Tasks - just drop down the list of connectors to send messages to Slack, Teams, Email, SMS, or any other system you need to integrate with.

## Extensions and Pre-Built Workflows
There are a number of common workflows or reusable components (call activities) that are common across many organizations.  Take advantage of our years of experience by using our commercial grade workflows to accelerate and bootstrap your efforts.
