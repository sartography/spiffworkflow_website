description:  How to get support for SpiffWorkflow and SpiffArena. 
---
Commercial companies with mission-critical installations of SpiffArena and SpiffWorkflow may require enhanced support including fast response times to questions, disaster recovery plans, and regular checkups to ensure their systems remain stable, up to date, and are protected against major security vulnerabilities.  For these cases we offers paid support plans to provide these organizations and groups with priority responses via chat rooms and GitHub, and allow them direct access to core personnel through phone, video, email, and private chat.

Please refer to the chart below for a comparison of service levels.

Paid support contracts are offered at three levels - Bronze, Silver and Gold:
