## Our Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Mechanisms
We and our service providers use cookies and other tracking mechanisms to track information about your use of our Sites or Services. We may combine this information with other personal information we collect from you (and our service providers may do so on our behalf). We use cookies for functional purposes only (i.e. to support the proper working of our Sites and Services) and do not use cookies for advertising or profiling purposes.

Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your device’s hard drive through your web browser for record-keeping purposes. Some cookies allow us to make it easier for you to navigate our Sites and Services, while others are used to enable a faster log-in process or to allow us to track your activities at our Sites and Service. There are two types of cookies: session and persistent cookies.

* *Session cookies:* exist only during an online session. They disappear from your device when you close your browser or turn off your device. We use session cookies to allow our systems to uniquely identify you during a session or while you are logged into the Sites and Services. This allows us to process your online transactions and requests and verify your identity, after you have logged in, as you move through our Sites and Services.
* *Persistent Cookies:* Persistent cookies remain on your device after you have closed your browser or turned off your device. We use persistent cookies to track aggregate and statistical information about user activity. 

**Disabling Cookies:** Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can change your browser options to block them in the future. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Visitors to our Sites and Services who disable cookies will be able to browse certain areas of the Sites, but some features may not function properly.

**Third Party Analytics:** We use automated devices and applications, such as Google Analytics, to evaluate usage of our Sites. We use these tools to help us improve our site’s performance and user experiences.

**Do-Not-Track.** Currently, our systems do not recognize browser “do-not-track” requests. You may, however, disable certain tracking as discussed in this section (e.g., by disabling cookies).

## User Generated Content
We invite you to post content on our Sites and Services, including your comments, pictures, and any other information that you would like to be available on our Sites or Services. If you post content to our Sites or Services the information that you post will be available to all visitors to our Sites. If you post your own content on our Sites or Services, your posting may become public and we cannot prevent such information from being used by third parties.

## Third-Party Links
Our Sites and Services may contain links to third-party websites. Any access to, and use of, such linked websites is not governed by this Policy, but instead is governed by the privacy policies of those third-party websites. We are not responsible for the information practices of such third-party websites.

## Security of My Personal Information
We have implemented reasonable precautions to protect the information we collect from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Please be aware that despite our best efforts, no data security measures can guarantee security.

You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password, phone, and computer by, among other things, signing off after using a shared computer, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, and keeping your log-in and password private. We are not responsible for any lost, stolen, or compromised passwords or for any activity on your account via unauthorized password activity.

## What Choices Do I Have Regarding Use of My Personal Information?
We may send periodic promotional emails to you regarding SpiffWorkflow. You may opt-out of promotional emails by following the opt-out instructions contained in the email. Please note that it may take up to 10 business days for us to process opt-out requests. If you opt-out of receiving promotional emails, we may still send you emails about your account or any services you have requested or received from us.
