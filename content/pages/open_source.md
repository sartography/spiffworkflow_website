## Get The Code and Join our Community!

SpiffWorkflow is made up of several open source projects available on GitHub.
We recommend you start with [SpiffArena](https://github.com/sartography/spiff-arena), but you can also delve into the [core workflow engine](https://github.com/sartography/SpiffWorkflow), [BPMN.IO editor extensions](https://github.com/sartography/bpmn-js-spiffworkflow), and the  [connector proxy](https://github.com/sartography/connector-proxy-demo).
