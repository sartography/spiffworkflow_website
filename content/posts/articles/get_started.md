### **Explore Example Processes**

Click on the "Example" option to explore pre-built workflow examples that showcase various functionality and use cases.
In the "Example" section, you will find a list of top-level process models and groups.
These examples represent complete workflows with predefined steps and tasks.

Select one of the top-level examples, such as "Minimal Example" or "Essential Example" to view the corresponding process model and diagram.

### **Explore BPMN Editor**

If you wish to view and make changes to the process diagram. Open a .bpmn file and you will have a visual diagram representing the workflow. Take a closer look at the diagram and familiarize yourself with the elements, such as start events, tasks, and end events.

You can access detailed information and properties in the right sidebar by clicking on individual tasks. Make modifications to the diagram by adding or modifying tasks, connecting elements, or updating properties.

To modify the instructions displayed for manual tasks, navigate to the "Instructions" field. For example, if you wish to update the information in the manual task named "Show Example Manual Task" below, click "Launch Editor." This action will open the editor, allowing you to change the displayed content.

**Note:** In order to save any changes, you must have an editor role. To acquire this role, you must request access to a playground (see below). Once you have the editor role, you can save your modifications successfully.


### **Requesting a Playground**

To access the editor role and create your own diagrams, start by requesting a playground.

Within the playground, you will find a container assigned to your name. Inside this container, you will have access to multiple tasks and process models. You can utilize this environment to create your own process models and make necessary modifications to the diagrams. This includes adding or modifying tasks, connecting elements, and updating properties. Furthermore, you can save these changes to ensure your progress is preserved.
